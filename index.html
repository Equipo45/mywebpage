        <p>Hello, I'm Ismael I am 22 years old and I love learning and programming, I have been playing around with technology
 since 2018, my favorite part of it is having always something new to learn. In my working experience I learned that
 working is about having patience and loving what you are doing, I have work with teams in the past and in the present, as I am studying systems information engineering and I have to work with my classmates. I would love to make the practice in your company,learning and helping as much as I can.
